# raspysl
a small project for my raspberry pi. I was sick and tired of going to SL's app or website all the time to just see when the nextcoming bus is leaving from my closest busstation. 
So I decided to get a touchscreen for my Raspberry Pi and made this little script (including GUI) and i sat it up in my hallway for easy access.

Written in Python and it's using the API from Trafiklab to get the timetable of the buses.
